​
## Premise
​
It is January 2023 and we continue to be in the middle of an all-out war between Russia and Ukraine. Northern African and Middle East nations are suffering unparalleled starvation as their food supply is stockpiled throughout Ukraine and rotting. The Black Sea continues to be heavily guarded by Turkey and the stand-off between Ukraine's Army and its underwater mines, and Russia's unrivaled Navy at bay is still ongoing.
 
I am hired as an external consultant Data Analyst for an International Affairs Panel on the topic immigration policies for the United Nations. They show a special interest on how developed nations can solve their long term issues included but not limited to: low fertility rates, population pyramid inversion and crippling pension debt. Therefore, they want to know how might new immigration policies impact their countries existing infrastructure, as they prepare to receive refugees by the millions.

​
## Hypothesis
​
My educated guess is that immigration, with the right policies, can solve the demographic dilemma in developed Nations.
The demographic dilemma is the situation where a country's Human Development Index and Life expectancy is inversely proportional to its population fertility rate, which depicts a grim future for developed nations.
 
In addition, fertility rates which are lower than 2 means that the difference in births and deaths would produce population declines and substantial increases in average ages, both of which could disrupt labor markets, threaten the fiscal sustainability of pension systems, as well as slow down economic growth, unless total net immigration offsets such declines.
 
Hence, I believe that not only would it be beneficial for a developed nation to adopt the right immigration policies for its prosperity and economic growth, but also it is imperative for a developed nation's survival, as these population trends transcend culture and geography, they are intrinsic to Humankind.

## Project files
​
The main directory has 3 subdirectories:
- Input: Holds the data used to analyze the hypothesis. It is a folder with multiple files which are then merged into a single dataframe in the Output folder df_clean.
- Output: Contains the df created from the original data, and a folder named images with the figures that are used multiple times through the project.
- src: Contains python files with all functions created specifically for this analysis.
- README: This file works both as a report and a presentation tool for the project
In the root directory there are 2 Jupyter Notebook files that include all the code used in the project:
- "Exploratory data analysis" (EDA): This file explores the data (how much data there is, how is it organized and the quality of it). This file also scrapes information from wikipedia on Net Migration by country and merges all input files into a single dataframe.
- Plotting: This file is used to create plots that help visualize the data in order to check if the hypothesis is true.
